# PBM_Schemes
This repository contains scripts that can be used to explore the numerical solution of a variety of population balance models. Principally, three numerical schemes are considered: the Upwind, Lax-Wendroff and Leapfrog schemes. Further information can be found in the primary manuscript, supplementary information and within the actual scripts. 

## Model 1

We consider a population balance model of the form: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} %2B g\frac{\partial f}{\partial a} = 0 \ , \ f(t=0,a) = f_{0},">

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f"> is the number density, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t">  is time, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a"> can potentially be the age or length or any other appropriate variable and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g"> is a constant and positive growth rate. A Neumann boundary condition is imposed on the right boundary of the domain and a modified Dirichlet boundary condition on the left domain which specifies that cell at the ghost node on the left domain (i.e. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a<0"> ) is 0. Refer to the main text for a more detailed explanation. 

On a separate script, the function can be called as follows: 

```matlab
[f, stride_vec] = model_1(101,@(x)(1/0.01)*exp(-x./0.01),0.5,1.0,"Leapfrog",[0,1],[0,1],"output_style","stride",10);
```

The various input and output arguments are outlined in the comments within the function script. The mesh and the values of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_{0}">should be precomputed and supplied accordingly. 

An example plot can be seen below:

## Model 2

We consider a population balance model with a variable growth rate as follows: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} %2B \frac{\partial ( g(a) f)}{\partial a} = 0 \ , \ f(t=0,a) = f_{0},">

The boundaries of the domain are treated in the same manner as model 1. 

As described in the manuscript, three model formulations were considered: 

1. Applying finite differencing directly on the equation on a uniform mesh (`model_2_conservative_uniform.m`)
2. Applying finite differencing on the conservative model formulation using a non-uniform mesh to enforce CFL = 1.0 at each point (`model_2_conservative_nonuniform.m`)
3. Applying finite differencing on the transformed model formulation with the non-uniform mesh from the second approach (`model_2_transformed_nonuniform.m`)
4. Applying the exact scheme presented in the manuscript (` model_2_exact.m`)

### Conservative, Uniform Grid

The first formulation can be employed as follows: 

```matlab
[f2,stride_vec2] = model_2_conservative_uniform(101,@(x)50*exp(-((x-0.2).^2)/0.0005), @(x)growth_rate(x), @(x)dudx(x), 1.0, "Upwind",[0,1],[0,1],"output_style","stride",20);
```

with the following associated functions for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g(a)"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g'(a)">: 

```matlab
function u = growth_rate(mesh)
u = 0.1*4.34 + 0.06*4.34*mesh;
end

function uprime = dudx(mesh)
uprime = 0.06*4.34*ones(length(mesh),1);
end
```

### Conservative, Non-uniform Grid

The second formulation can be employed as follows: 

```matlab
[f3,mesh3, stride_vec3] = model_2_conservative_nonuniform(0.02,@(x)50*exp(-((x-0.2).^2)/0.0005),@(x)growth_rate(x),@(x)dudx(x), "Upwind", [0,1],[0,1],"output_stytle","stride",20);
```

Note that there is a difference in the input arguments. The function computes the mesh for a given <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta t"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g(a)">. Correspondingly, the initial profile <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_{0}"> should be inputted as a function handle as well. 

### Transformed, Non-uniform Grid

The implementation is similar to the previous case. 

```matlab
[f4,mesh4, stride_vec4] = model_2_transform_nonuniform(0.02,@(x)50*exp(-((x-0.2).^2)/0.0005),@(x)growth_rate(x),@(x)dudx(x), "Upwind", [0,1],[0,1],"output_stytle","stride",20);
```

### Exact Scheme

The exact scheme is a bit more involved as a few terms need to be evaluated beforehand. The function definition is as follows:

```matlab
function [f, mesh] = model_2_exact(N_cells, f0_transfun, ufun, zfun, xfun, x_vec, t_end)
```

- `f0_transfun` is given by: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{f}_{0}(a) = g(a)f(0,a)">
- `ufun` is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g(a)">
- `zfun` is given by: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int_{0}^{a}\frac{1}{g(a')}da'">
- `xfun` is the inverse of `zfun`

The exact scheme can be used as follows

```matlab
[f5, mesh5] = model_2_exact(101, @(x)f0_transfun(x), @(x)growth_rate(x), @(x)(50/(3*4.34))*log(5+3*x), @(x)(exp((3*4.34/50)*x) -5)/3, [0,1], 1);
```

With the following function also added into the script:

```matlab
function f = f0_transfun(x)
f = (0.434 + 0.2604*x).*(50*exp(-((x-0.2).^2)/0.0005));
end
```

### Sample Plot

## Model 3

A non-homogeneous population balance model of the form is considered: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} %2B g\frac{\partial f}{\partial a} = \alpha(a) \ , \ f(t=0,a) = f_{0}">

The function can be used as follows:

```matlab
[f6,stride_vec6] = model_3(201,@(x)50*exp(-((x-0.2).^2)/0.0005),0.5,@(x)(1+(0.1*x)+(0.1*x.^2)),@(x)(0.1 + 0.2.*x),1.0,"Lax Wendroff",[0,1],[0,1],"output_style","stride",20);
```

## Model 4

We consider a non-homogeneous model with a linear term as follows:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} %2B g\frac{\partial f}{\partial a} = \alpha(a)f \ , \ f(t=0,a) = f_{0}">

### Na√Øve Scheme

The straightforward finite difference scheme can be used as follows:

```matlab
[f7,stride_vec7] = model_4_naive(501,@(x)50*exp(-((x-0.2).^2)/0.0005), @(x)x, @(x)1,@(x)(0), 1.0, [0,1],[0,2], "Upwind", "output_style","stride",40);
```

### Exact Scheme

The exact scheme can be used as follows:

```matlab
[f8,stride_vec8] = model_4_exact(101,@(x)50*exp(-((x-0.2).^2)/0.0005),@(x)intk(x), @(x)(0), [0,1], [0,2],"output_style","stride",20);
```

with the following function included in the script to compute <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int_{0}^{a}\lambda(a')da' ">:

```matlab
function f = intk(x)
f = 0.5*(x.^2);
end
```
